### Exploring GitHub
I am learning a lot through the __Skills__ content. It seems like a really great foundation to becoming a familiar GitHub user.

This is a relatively new world to me but I am loving it so far. It's _amazing_ to peel back the curtains on web content. And I love a technical challenge!
